Welcome to AnimeHub, a handy tool for all anime fans. Made with advanced machine learning, AnimeHub serves all anime lovers across the world by suggesting the right anime just for you. Browse top anime from different genres, get personalized recommendations, or find the name of an anime from a story you remember. With AnimeHub, exploring the world of anime is easy and fun.

## Project Description üìù

This project encompasses the following key features:

- **Top Genres**: Browse through the top anime from various genres.
- **Personal Picks**: Get personalized anime recommendations. Users rate selected anime and a machine learning model suggests animes to watch based on their taste and preferences.
- **Anime Whisperer**: Don't remember the title of an anime but remember the story? This feature helps users find the anime title from the story.
- **Otaku Insights**: An analytical dashboard offering insights into anime data.

## Motivation üí°

The primary motivation behind this project was to assist anime enthusiasts, especially those who are relatively new to the world of anime like my friend who inspired this project. Having watched anime only on his friends' recommendations, he was neither a complete novice nor a seasoned anime geek. I wanted to offer him, and many others like him, a personalized platform where they could explore new animes based on their taste and preferences. And thus, AnimeHub was born.

(PS: As someone who has never watched anime, everything was new and exciting for me, and this project was driven entirely by the insights from the data I worked with.)

## Tech Stack üõ†

The application is built entirely on Python and Streamlit.
